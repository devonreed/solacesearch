I added the following functionality/support:

- database querying
- simple pagination
- querying by string as well as minimum years of experience

I also did some modest restyling of the frontend and fixes for anything that looked like obvious anti-patterns or violations of "the React way"

There's plenty that's left incomplete at this point, but I'm trying to stick to the two hours suggestion that was offered at the outset. Some additional improvements I might make if there was more time:

- Sort/order by column
- Selectable degrees, specialties, cities
- More colorful/attractive styling
